# Website Report:

For my blog, I decided that I would make a human-rights related forum, as I am very passionate in this area of interest. 

## Design Plugins

While wordpress provided an extensive set of themes to choose from, I felt that the ability to create a custom design with a template was quite limited. As such, an issue would have been the **lack of creativity** with the site's design. 
As such, I decided to implement a **front-end page builder plugin**, as this would give me more freedom to make design choices to materialise the vision I had for my website. 
**I chose elementor,** as it provided a very simple interface and was easy to operate, thanks to its drag-and-drop method. I also considered other similar plugins such as Brizy, however decided against it. I opted for elementor because of its compatability with many other plugins - this would be particularly helpful for plugins that added extra word-press widgets such as a recent-posts-with-thumbnails or a wp-form (see below).

It also included additional plugins that enhanced the front-end page building aspects of elementor, such as **Happy Add-Ons.** Elementor and its extra components therefore rendered it versatile and made it the best choice.

Through elementor, I was able to embrace my creativity and designed a site with complementing colours and one that looked neat and appealing to the eye. I was also able to easily manage the columns to create an organised space for my posts and information.

## Security and Error-Assisting Plugins

Another issue was the fact that my blog was **open to many threats and dangers,** both technological and social. Dangers such as people spamming the comments secton of my blog or even the contact form if they dissatisfied with the content that I was publishing, as well as people hacking into the site for various reasons. As such, **an anti-spam plugin** which protects against automated spam tools and filters out any spam requests would be necessary. A **security plugin** would also be needed to prevent individuals hijacking the website with viruses and malware. 

I chose **Akhismet's anti-spam plugin** over other plugins because of the simplistic manner in which wordpress users could utilise the anti-spam effects - It was as simple as following a few clear steps.
I also chose **WordFence Security** for the same reasons: all I needed to do was enter my e-mail to receive security alerts in order to enjoy the benefit of full website protection.

In addition to security plugins, another potential issue was **inevitable errors that site-users may end up at.** As such, I required **a redirecting plugin,** which was able to explain the problem which the user had encountered rather than to leave them confused. 
I decided that the **Redirection plugin** would be optimal over other plugins, as it was much easier to use than .htaccess. Automatic creation of redirections when a post URL changes and the ability to keep track of common 404 errors were all factors that increased the appeal of this plugin. It was configured by merely undergoing the setup.

The security, anti-spam and redirection plugins increased the viability of the site, as it is now protected and can successfully deal with errors, spam and viruses.

## Widget Plugins

Wordpress also **did not have certain widgets,** such as a form widget for web-users to be able to contact the web host. Furthermore, while there was a recent-posts widget, I desired a more aesthetic widget which allowed for photos to accompany posts.

In order to fulfil my creative vision of design for the website, I installed **WPForms Lite** - easily building a contact form by adjusting certain criteria - and **Recent Posts Widget With Thumbnails** - a widget which allowed me to neatly display my recent posts next to an image. Both plugins appealed to me over other counter-parts thanks to their compatability with elementor. In this way, I was able to merely drag and drop these widgets in.

These widgets helped overall with the design aspects of the site.

## SEO, Analytics and Cache Plugins

To **more easily promote and find my website in search engines** such as google, I decided to install an **SEO plugin.** I chose the **Yoast SEO plugin** over other popular SEO plugins, as it boasted more useful features that better assisted my website - the ability to import data from webmaster tools; breadcrumb navigation; and other social features that are all clearly outlined in an easy-to-read interface are all advantages of this plugin. Furthermore, the content analysis feature appeared to be very beginner-friendly compared to other plugins. All in all, I was able to configure personal settings after installation, even with my inexperience.

With Yoast SEO, people would now be able to more easily find my site through general searches such as 'human rights blog'.

To be able to **see which posts gain the most attention and which posts are not popular** with my readerbase, an **analytics plugin** was also necessary. I chose **Google Analytics for WordPress by Monster Insights,** which allowed for cross-platform analysis. This was appealing, as I constructed my site to be responsive for all devices. Furthermore, the plugin was easily configured with a google account, which was advantageous over other plugins. In this way, the analytics of my site are readily available and can be easily checked.

With this analytics plugin, I would now be able to continue writing content that people are interested in or to discontinue types of issues that people may not consider relevant. I now would also be able to see which platform is most popular for my site and to improve responsiveness or desisgn aspects based on those analytics. 

Finally, I decided that I would need a **cache plugin** to enhance the operating speed of my site, due to **potential issues with site slowness.** I opted for **LiteSpeed Cache,** as it guaranteed acceleration and optimisation features of other cache plugins. However, in addition to standard features, it was also compatible with Yoast SEO, which made it more appealing to include as a plugin. I was able to implement the plugin by adjusting the various settings, such as page and image optimisation to accelerate my site.

With LiteSpeed Cache in place, my site would run at optimum capacity, which would allow web-users to leave my site with an overall positive perception of my blog.

## Conclusion

All in all, my use of the plugins was able to solve all of my website's issues.
